# Data interoperability in the software stack

A number of tools have been developed for ACE. 

For example, I think that Ace Wiki is a good environment for collaboratively authoring and validating statements within an organisation. The community should be able to rapidly prototype and self assess the veracity of statements. However, it is important that these facts can be used to generate an ontology within OWL. Hence, the statements should be able to be exported for use in other applications. Likewise if a knowledge engineer has generated an ontology then they would want to export this as a series of CNL facts and that these facts should beable to be community reviewed in the wiki.

This sections describes how to get stuff in and out of the different applications and any limitations or leakages associated with the software stack.
